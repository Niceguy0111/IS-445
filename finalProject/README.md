IS 445 - Data Visualizations
Final Project

Biggest Takeaway:

Context, context, context! By far the most impactful lesson I've learned from this class is to narrow down the audience for each visualization. This acheives several things: Firstly, in asking general questions about who will be utilizing/viewing your visualization, you will learn keywords and patterns that may be useful highlighting in your diagram. Secondly, you will gain access to sites and resources that you may not have been aware of previously, things like example visuals that the audience may be familiar with or context for certain data trends that are assumed to be known within the audience's sphere of knowledge. Finally, you will be able to simplify your visualization to the bare essentials, as a common problem with visuals is overcrowding and lack of specificity. Irrelevant data can be encapsulated or fully removed from the diagram depending on what the audience cares about.



Some Improvements:

I am a creature of habit, which means for classwork I enjoy an in-person or pseudo-in-person environment that I attend at least once a week to receive updates from my instructors. Given the unfortunate circumstances of the class cancellations this semester, I was a bit unmotivated towards the end of the semester to complete this project. However, I still managed to finish,  I just wish I spent more time refining my process by starting earlier. Other than that, I loved the content and the Jupyter Notebook format as I'm very experienced with them.
